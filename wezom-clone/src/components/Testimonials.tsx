We worked with the team on several projects, including the development of a CRM with adaptation for desktop and mobile versions, as well as the creation of a suite of server applications that are available on iOS, Android, and online. We are very pleased with the results and the flexibility of the WEZOM team."

The guys conducted a market analysis, created a mind map with all the functions of the future site, and argued for each element of development. Everything was transparent, and the quality was high."
